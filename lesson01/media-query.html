                <p>And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they were
                    not half so numerous as the Lamanites. But they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and for
                    their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.</p>
